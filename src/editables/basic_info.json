	"about_me": "I am a passionate developer and aspiring entrepreneur with interest in the intersection of technology and business and upcoming technologies. I especially enjoy seeking inventive solutions for real world problems as well as working with people and leading teams.

I am a proud golden bear studying computer science at UC Berkeley, with an interest in economics as well. From my studies and experiences, I have become skilled at programming in Python, Java, HTML, and CSS.

Currently, I am serving as a Strategy Consultant at Valley Consulting Group, a UC Berkeley based management consulting firm which provides strategy consulting services to leading technology companies like Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, and Dropbox. I’m currently working on an exciting project with Microsoft designing and implementing strategies to find local Bay Area partners for Microsoft’s initiative to increase digital literacy.

I'm interested in a wide range of roles, from software engineering to data science to managerial economics, and I’m looking for a team to encourage me to work harder and smarter.

If you have a job opportunity, or would just like to chat, feel free to email me any time at smithapriya@berkeley.edu.",
